# Spark - Storytelling AI BOT
Spark is an innovative AI-powered storytelling platform that lets users create unique stories by choosing their heroes and the settings for the story. With Spark, users can unleash their imagination and create endless possibilities for their stories.

## Features

- Users can choose from multiple categories, including Fantasy, Horror, and more.
- Users can select a place of action for their story, such as a forest or temple.
- Users can pick a hero for their story, such as a cat, dog, machine, and more.
- Users can create a unique story every time they use the platform.


## How it works
When a user logs in to Spark, they are prompted to choose a category for their story. Based on the category, the AI generates the first part of the story in the backend. The user is then prompted to choose a place of action for their story, and the AI generates the second part of the story accordingly. Next, the user is prompted to choose a hero for their story, and the AI generates the third part of the story. There are a few more prompts to create a complete story. Each pick by the user generates a unique story.

## Tech Stack
Spark uses a variety of technologies to provide users with a seamless storytelling experience. The frontend of the site is built using React Nextjs, while the backend is written in Python FastAPI. The database used by the platform is MongoDB.
